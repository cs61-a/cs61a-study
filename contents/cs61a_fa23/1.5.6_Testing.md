## Doctest

Doctest is a module in Python's standard library that allows you to write tests based on examples embedded in the documentation strings (docstrings) of your code.

Doctest provides a way to create tests that are both documentation and executable code. The tests are written in plain text and are typically placed in the docstrings of functions, modules, or classes. The examples demonstrate how the code should be used, and doctest automatically extracts these examples and executes them as tests.

A example of a Python module with a function and corresponding doctests:

```python
def square(n):
    """
    Returns the square of a number.

    >>> square(2)
    4
    >>> square(-3)
    9
    """
    return n ** 2

def greet(name):
    """
    Greets a person by their name.

    >>> greet("Alice")
    'Hello, Alice!'
    >>> greet("Bob")
    'Hello, Bob!'
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
```

In this example, we have two functions: `square()` and `greet()`. Each function has a docstring with embedded examples and expected outputs. The `square()` function calculates the square of a number, while the `greet()` function generates a greeting message.

At the bottom of the module, there's a conditional check `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure that the doctests are only executed when the module is run directly, rather than imported.


To run the doctests, you can execute the module directly using the `python` command:

```
python your_module_name.py
```

The` doctest.testmod()` function automatically discovers and runs the tests within the docstrings. If all tests pass, no output is displayed. If there are any failures, the details of the failed tests will be printed to the console.

Doctests offer a simple and integrated way to write and execute tests alongside your code, making it easier to ensure that your code functions as expected.
