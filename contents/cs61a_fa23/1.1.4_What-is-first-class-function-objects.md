# What is first-class function objects?

First-class function objects, also known as first-class functions or first-class citizens, refer to a programming language's ability to treat functions as entities with the same rights and capabilities as other values, such as integers, strings, or objects. In languages that support first-class function objects, functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, returned as results from functions, and stored in data structures.

Here are some characteristics and capabilities of first-class function objects:

1. **Assignable:** Functions can be assigned to variables or stored in data structures, just like other values. This allows functions to be treated as data and manipulated dynamically at runtime.

2. **Passable as Arguments:** Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. This allows functions to be used as callbacks or to define behavior dynamically based on different conditions or inputs.

3. **Returnable as Results:** Functions can be returned as results from other functions. This enables functions to generate and return new functions or modify behavior based on certain conditions.

4. **Storable in Data Structures:** Functions can be stored in data structures, such as arrays, lists, or dictionaries. This allows functions to be organized and accessed like other data elements.

5. **Higher-Order Functions:** Functions that can accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions are known as higher-order functions. They facilitate powerful abstractions and enable functional programming paradigms.

Support for first-class function objects is a desirable feature in programming languages as it enables more expressive, flexible, and modular code. It allows functions to be treated as data, making it easier to implement higher-level concepts, such as callbacks, event handling, functional programming patterns, and metaprogramming. Languages like Python, JavaScript, and many functional programming languages provide robust support for first-class function objects.
