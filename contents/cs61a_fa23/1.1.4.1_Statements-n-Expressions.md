# 1.1.4 Statements & Expressions

**Statements & Expressions.** Python code consists of expressions and statements. Broadly, computer programs consist of instructions to either

1. Compute some value
2. Carry out some action

Statements typically describe actions. When the Python interpreter executes a statement, it carries out the corresponding action. On the other hand, expressions typically describe computations. When Python evaluates an expression, it computes the value of that expression. 

**Exploring**

An example that demonstrates the difference between `statements and expressions`:

```rust
fn print_number(n: i32) {
    // This is a statement (no value produced)
    println!("The number is: {}", n);
}

fn get_number() -> i32 {
    // This is an expression (produces a value)
    let x = 42;
    x   // no ; here
}

fn main() {
    print_number(10);
    let number = get_number();
    println!("Number: {}", number);
}
```
