# The print in python and console.log in javascript are Non-pure functions?

**ChatGPT:** Yes, both the `print()` function in Python and the `console.log()` function in JavaScript can be considered non-pure functions.

A pure function is a function that always produces the same output given the same inputs and has no side effects. It means that the function's only purpose is to compute a value based on its input, and it does not modify any external state or have any observable effects other than the return value.

In the case of `print()` in Python and `console.log()` in JavaScript, they have side effects by design. They write the provided data to the console or terminal, which is an external state change. These functions do not strictly adhere to the definition of pure functions because they have observable effects beyond returning a value.

Additionally, `print()` in Python and `console.log()` in JavaScript do not return a value that can be directly used or assigned to a variable. In Python, the `print()` function returns None, indicating that it does not produce a meaningful value. In JavaScript, `console.log()` does not return anything and, by default, returns undefined.

Therefore, both `print()` in Python and `console.log()` in JavaScript can be considered non-pure functions due to their side effects and lack of meaningful return values.

**In JavaScript:**

```js
hello = console.log("hello");
console.log(hello);
```

The code `console.log("hello")` prints "hello" to the console, but the `console.log()` function does not return any value. Therefore, `hello` will be assigned the value of `undefined`. When you try to log the value of `hello` using `console.log(hello)`, it will output `undefined` to the console.

**In Python:**

```py
hello = print('hello')
print(hello)
```

The code `print('hello')` prints "hello" to the console. However, the `print()` function in Python does not return any value (or returns `None`, to be precise). Therefore, `hello` will be assigned the value of `None`. When you try to print the value of `hello` using `print(hello)`, it will output `None` to the console.

**To summarize:**

-   In JavaScript,` console.log()` does not return a value, so assigning the result of `console.log("hello")` to a variable will result in `undefined`.
-   In Python, `print()` also does not return a value (or returns `None`), so assigning the result of `print('hello')` to a variable will result in `None`.
