# Can I open a file located on internet with url link?

**ChatGPT:** Yes, you can open a file located on the internet with a URL link using Python's built-in urllib module. Here's an example of how to do it:

```py
import urllib.request

url = "https://example.com/myfile.txt"

with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:
    data = response.read().decode('utf-8')
    # Do something with the data, e.g.
    print(data)
```

In this example, `urllib.request.urlopen()` is used to open the URL and return a file-like object. The `with` statement is used to automatically close the file-like object when the block is exited. The `response.read()` method is used to read the contents of the file, and `decode('utf-8')` is used to convert the binary data to a string. Finally, you can do something with the data, such as print it to the console.
